# Frontend Frenzy

Welcome to Frontend Frenzy. This game was inspired by Cookie Clicker and made for my school class so students can ~~slack off~~ have fun
<ul>
    <li>Upgrade your IDE / Code Editor</li>
    <li>Bytes = money</li>
    <li>Loops = infinite bytes!</li>
</ul>

The main gameplay loop is just to get as many bytes as possible through upgrading and idling
